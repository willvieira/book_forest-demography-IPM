# Coexistence {#sec-coex}

Calculate invasion growth rate ($\lambda$) for pair of competing species in two different conditions:

- Invasion growth rate without competition: $\lambda_{i,N_j = 0}$ 
- Invasion growth rate with competing species at equilibrium: $\lambda_{i,N_j^\ast}$ 

Both lambdas are then used to calculate the sensitivity ($S_i$) of the invading species $i$ to the resident species $j$:

$$
S_i = \frac{\lambda_{i,N_j = 0} - \lambda_{i,N_j^\ast}}{\lambda_{i,N_j = 0}}
$$

With the sensitivity of both species ($S_i$ and $S_j$) to the other, we can finally compute the two coexistence metrics: niche difference (ND) and relative fitness difference (RFD) following @Narwani2013 and @Carroll2011:

$$
ND = 1 - \sqrt{S_i S_j}
$$

$$
RFD = \sqrt{\frac{S_i}{S_j}}
$$

Note that both ND and RFD can be computed with total population size ($N^\ast$) or total biomass ($BA^\ast$) instead of the invasion growth rate. Also note that both ND and RFD are in function of temperature and precipitation set to the optima value of the resident species $j$. Finally, they are also dependent on plot random effects that are defined to zero for the moment.

## Sensitivity

Sensitivity of invader species i over resident speciesj at equilibrium within its optimal environment.

Using BA among the three metrics (reason to be described), next figure shows the distribution of BA sensitivity across species and their shade tolerance.

## Average conspecific and heterospecific competition

#### $\alpha_{ii}$

Using the carrying capacity ($K = BA_{i,N_j = 0}$) to define $\alpha_{ii} = 1/K$:
